# ü™û Doppelganger ‚Äì Mimic the Soul, Leave No Trace
Doppelganger is an arcane tool designed to mimic LSASS, extract its secrets, and hide them in plain sight. It builds upon the forbidden arts of HollowReaper, using hollowed processes, kernel exploits, and spectral clones to bypass protection and exfiltrate credentials with stealth.

## üìú The Ritual
### ü©∏ Doppelganger
The soul thief. This shellcode:

üõ°Ô∏è Disables PPL using the cursed RTCore64.sys driver (BYOVD)

üß¨ Clones LSASS into a benign replica

üíæ Creates a Minidump from the clone

üóùÔ∏è XOR-encrypts the dump and writes it to disk, leaving behind only a shadow

üìú Writes logs in C:\Users\Public\log.txt

### üßø Utilities
#### üíÄ HollowReaper.c
The vessel for your payload. This performs process hollowing, carving out a legitimate process and injecting your shellcode into its husk.
üîß Instructions for generating the shellcode to embed are provided in the HollowReaper project.

#### üîê decrypt_xor_dump.py
A local decryption utility. Use this to restore the original dump from its XOR-obfuscated form.

## ‚öóÔ∏è The Components
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Doppelganger | The shellcode: disable PPL, clone LSASS, dump and XOR |
| HollowReaper.c |	Hollow a process and inject shellcode |
| decrypt_xor_dump.py | Python tool to decrypt XOR dump |
| RTCore64.sys | Vulnerable driver used for PPL bypass (BYOVD) |

## üïØÔ∏è Usage Flow
### Standalone
In order to use Doppelganger you must place RTCore64.sys in C:\Users\Public. Doppleganger can be used standalone or hollowed through HollowReaper.
```
.\Doppelganger.exe
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Process Hollowed

1Ô∏è‚É£ Compile Doppelganger

2Ô∏è‚É£ Use Donut to convert it into shellcode
```
.\donut.exe -a 2 -f 7 -i Doppelganger.exe
```
3Ô∏è‚É£ XOR the shellcode and embed it into HollowReaper.c (look for util files in [HollowReaper](https://github.com/vari-sh/RedTeamGrimoire/tree/main/HollowReaper))

4Ô∏è‚É£ Run HollowReaper to hollow a process and trigger Doppelganger (all files saved to C:\Users\Public)
```
.\HollowReaper.exe "C:\windows\explorer.exe"
```
5Ô∏è‚É£ Use decrypt_xor_dump.py to decrypt the dumped file offline
```
python .\decrypt_xor_dump.py .\doppelganger.dmp
```

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Counterspell - YARA Rules

The following YARA rules can be used to detect Doppelganger binary, artifacts, and opcode stubs in memory or on disk.

These rules were generated using [`yarGen`](https://github.com/Neo23x0/yarGen) to match unique patterns such as string constants related to the Doppelganger LSASS dumper.
